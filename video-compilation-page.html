        <h2>Summer in Rio - Bossa/Summer Lofi</h2>
        <p>Summer in Rio blends smooth bossa grooves with mellow lofi beats, capturing the laid-back energy of Brazil’s most iconic city. Born on Rio’s beaches in the late 1950s, bossa nova fused samba rhythms with jazz harmony and soft vocals, a sound both timeless and deeply expressive. This 28-track compilation brings that spirit to life: the first 14 tracks dive into bossa lofi with guitars and syncopated rhythms, while the last 14 ease into warm, expansive summer lofi. From beachside mornings to golden hour evenings, this is summer on loop.</p>
