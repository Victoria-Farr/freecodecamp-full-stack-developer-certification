  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dried lotus seeds</li>
      <li>Peanut Oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
      <li>Honey</li>
      <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Soak dried lotus seeds overnight in water. The next day, drain the lotus seeds.</li>
    <li>Add them to a sauce pan with fresh water that just covers the lotus seeds. Simmer for 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Once done simmering, blend the lotus seeds and water until it is a smooth texture.</li>
    <li>Pour the lotus seed puree through a fine mesh sieve back into a saute pan.</li>
    <li>Over medium heat, reduce the lotus mixture until it is 2/3 the original amount until it is as thick as a very thick soup. Add the peanut oil 1 tbsp at a time and stir after each tbsp is added.</li>
    <li>Next, add the salt, sugar, and honey. Stir and flip the mixture constantly until it becomes a paste. The paste should be done once it starts to pull away from the pan and hold its shape.</li>
    <li>Set aside to cool in the fridge for at least an hour. While the paste is cooling, make the mooncake skin. Combine golden syrup, peanut oil, and lye water in a small bowl. Mix until incorporated. Add the flour and mix until a dough forms. Set aside to cool in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>After you have weighed out the ingredients for 1 mooncake, form the mooncake. Roll the lotus paste in a ball and flatten it so it becomes a disk. Place the salty egg in the center of the disk and enclose the egg with the lotus paste. Once enclosed, roll it between your hands to create a smooth ball.</li>
